One of the projects I wrote was an indico uri shortening service, called <em><a hhref="http://aidansean.com/projects/?p=191">i</a></em> (or indigo, depending on how ugly "<em>i</em>" looks in context) but I wanted to go a step further.  So I write a greasemonkey script so that I could get to indico pages without even loading the main page.  This takes up very few pixels on the screen, making it much faster to get to the meeting pages.

<h3>Overview</h3>

This is a rather simple script.  It simply redirects (in a new tab) to the <em>i</em> page, which redirects to indico.
